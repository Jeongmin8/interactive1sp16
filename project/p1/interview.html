    	<h1>Prince William and Kate Middleton's love story</h1>
    	<img src="images/wedding.gif" style="width:500px" >

    	<br>
    	<br>

    	<p><b>Tom Bradby:</b> People are obviously very curious about you, so let's start with the obvious. William, where did you propose, when, how. And Kate, what did you say?</p>

		<p><b>Prince William:</b> It was about three weeks ago on holiday in Kenya. We had a little private time away together with some friends and I just decided that it was the right time really. We had been talking about marriage for a while so it wasn't a massively big surprise. I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya and I proposed.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Kate Middleton:</b> It was very romantic (laughs). There's a true romantic in there.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> So you said yes, obviously?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Of course, yes.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Absolutely.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> And you knew you were going to do this from day one of the holiday or you waited until the end?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> I'd been planning it for a while but as every guy out there will know it takes a certain amount of motivation to get yourself going. So I was planning it and then it just felt really right out in Africa. It was beautiful at the time. I just … I had done a little bit of planning to show my romantic side.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, you'd been on holiday a while so did you see this coming, was he getting a bit nervous and jumpy?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> No, not at all because we were out with friends and things so I really didn't expect it all. I thought he might have maybe thought about it, but no. It was a total shock when it came, and very excited.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> And produced a ring there and then?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Yes.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> there and then?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> I did, yes. I had been carrying it around with me in my rucksack for about three weeks before that and I literally would not let it go, everywhere I went I was keeping hold of it because I knew this thing, if it disappeared I would be in a lot of trouble and because I'd planned it, it went fine. You hear a lot of horror stories about proposing and things going horribly wrong - it went really, really well and I was really pleased she said yes.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> And it's a family ring?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> It is a family ring, yes. It's my mother's engagement ring. So I thought it was quite nice because obviously she's not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her sort of close to it all.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> I guess we better have a look at it. What kind of ring is it, are you an expert on what's …?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> I'm not an expert on it at all. I've been reliably informed it's a sapphire with some diamonds. I'm sure everyone recognizes it from previous times.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> It's beautiful.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, you're going to be the envy of many.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Well, I just hope I look after it. It's very, very special.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> If she loses it she's in big trouble.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Now it has to be said, you both look incredibly happy and relaxed.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> We are. We are. We're like sort of ducks, very calm on the surface with little feet going under the water. But uh no, it's been really exciting because we've been talking about it for a long time so for us, it's a real relief and it's really nice to be able to tell everybody. Especially for the last two or three weeks it's been quite difficult not telling anyone, and keeping it to ourselves for reasons we had to. And it's really nice to finally be able to share it with everyone.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> : And you obviously have kept it a secret. So when did you ask Kate's dad and what did he say and what did your respective parents say when you told them?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Well, I was torn between asking Kate's dad first and then the realisation that he might actually say 'no' dawned upon me. So I thought if I ask Kate first then he can't really say no. So I did it that way round. And I managed to speak to Mike sort of soon after it happened really and then it sort of happened from there.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, what did your mum say?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> I think as any mother would be she was absolutely over the moon. And actually we had quite an awkward situation because I knew and I knew that William had asked my father but I didn't know if my mother knew. So I came back from Scotland and my mother made it sort of … didn't make it clear to me whether she knew or not so both of us were there sort of looking at each other and feeling quite awkward about it. But it was amazing to tell her and obviously she was very happy for us.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> One of the things that has been clear for a long time is you very evidently have a close-knit family and family's very important to you.</p>

		<h3>Family is Important to Kate Middleton</h3>

		<img src="images/kate.jpg" style= "width:280px">
		<br>
		<br>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Yes. It's very important to me you know. And I hope we will be able to have a happy family ourselves. Because it's been …they've been great over the years - helping me with difficult times. We see a lot of each other and they are very, very dear to me.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> People are bound to ask you know. It's a bit of an obvious question but, children, do you want lots of children? You, know see what comes? What's your..?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> I think we'll take it one step at a time. We'll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we'll have to start thinking about that.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> When did you first set eyes on each other and what did you think?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Going back to the start because I think people as I say will be very curious about the totality of your relationship. When did you first set eyes on each other and what did you think?</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, what did you think of William. I mean it's clearly not quite the same as meeting your average you know university student, or maybe it was, I don't know. But what was your first impression?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Well I actually think I went bright red when I met you and sort of scuttled off, feeling very shy about meeting you. But um, actually William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there for Freshers Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other but we did become very close friends from quite early.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> There's a story that goes around that you had a picture of him on your wall.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> There wasn't just one, there was about 20.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> He wishes. No, I had the Levis guy on my wall, not a picture of William, sorry.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> It was me in Levis honestly.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> So you lived … you ended up sort of in the same flat, was that if you don't mind me asking, was before you were going out or?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> No we moved in together as friends because we were living together, we lived with a couple of others as well, and it just sort of blossomed from there really. We just saw more of each other, and you know hung out a bit more and did stuff. So um yeah.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> You liked the cooking.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Well your cooking is alright. (Kate laughs) It's gotten better.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Does William ever cook or indeed do anything useful around the house?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Define useful, Tom. </p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Let's not go there.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> No he does actually. He did cook for me quite a bit at university, and he would always come with a bit of angst and a bit of anger if something had gone wrong and I would have to wander in and save something that was going.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> So being honest is that a skill that's declining over time or improving?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> I would say I'm getting better at cooking. Kate would say I'm getting a lot worse.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> I don't give him enough chance to practice.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> No, that is true. I get quite lazy about cooking because when I come back from work it is the last thing I want to do, really is spend loads of time cooking. When I was trying to impress Kate I was trying to cook these amazing fancy dinners and what would happen was I would burn something, something would overspill, something would catch on fire and she would be sitting in the background trying to help, and basically taking control of the whole situation, so I was quite glad she was there at the time.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Slightly awkward for the other flatmates?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> No, to be honest they were used to it, watching things catching fire, they found it very amusing.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> But I mean having the two of you going out in the flat, or did they just not bat an eye lid?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> I think at first they were a bit surprised that it had happened, then they realized it was really nice and it was good fun and we got on really well, they were good friends of ours as well so we had a good giggle with them as well.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Now I suppose a lot of people are going to wonder, the first meeting with the families, again, not necessarily your average meeting. Kate what was your first impression of the family?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Well I was quite nervous about meeting William's father, but he was very, very welcoming, very friendly, so yea it couldn't have gone easier really for me.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Meeting the grandmother, the Queen, again not like your average meeting with a grandmother, were you nervous about that too?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> I first met her at Peter and Autumn's wedding and again it was amongst a lot of other guests and she was very friendly and no it was fine.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> She was very welcoming, she knew it was a big day and everything was going on with Peter and Autumn, she wanted to meet Kate for a while, so it was very nice for her to come over and say hello and have a little chat.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> You clearly are tremendously fond of each other's families and I'm guessing that is going to be a big part of your life going forward. Both your lives.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> It definitely will, as you know, Kate's family, Kate's got a very, very close family. And I get on really well with them and I'm very lucky that they've been so supportive. Mike and Carole have been really sort of loving and caring and really fun and have been really welcoming towards me so I've felt really a part of the family and I hope that Kate's felt the same with my family.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> People are bound to ask, you leave university, you have been going out a bit and you split up, famously, all over the papers, what was all that about, people are bound to want to know.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Well I think to be honest, I wouldn't believe everything you read in the paper but in that particular instance we did split up for a bit. But that was just, we both were very young, it was at university, we were sort of both finding ourselves as such and being different characters and stuff, it was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, and so it was just sort of a bit of space and a bit of things like that and it worked out for the better.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> And I think I at the time wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person, you find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised, or I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you are younger and I really valued that time for me as well although I didn't think it at the time. Looking back on it.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> It was a chance to re-centre yourself.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Yes, definitely, yea. I wasn't all bad. (Laughing)</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Phew! We're over that one.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Did you kind of always have at the back of your minds that you wanted to marry each other. Did that come slowly? Did you suddenly decide a couple of weeks ago, I mean people have assumed you were going to be married for a long time. How did you both come to it in your heads?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Well from my point of view I you know …when I first met Kate I knew there was something very special about her. I knew there was possibly something that I wanted to explore there. We ended up being friends for a while and that just sort of was a good foundation. Because I do generally believe now that being friends with one another is a massive advantage. And It just went from there. And over the years, I knew things were getting better and better and we went through a few stumbling blocks as every relationship does, but we really picked ourselves up and carried on and you know. From were you had the odd problem when you are first getting to know each other, it has all gone and it is just really easy being with each other, it is really fun and I'm extremely funny and she loves that so it's been good.(Laughing)</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, you were obviously upset when you split up but all your friends talk about there being a very substantial love that has built up over a period of time you know that's part friendship and obviously more than that.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very, very well, you go through the good times, you go through the bad times. You know both personally, but also within a relationship as well. And you know I think if you can come out of that stronger and learn as I said things about yourself, it certainly, it's been a good how many years?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Uh, well a lot of time.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> He did take his time, it must be said. Did you ever want him to come on...</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton: </b>Well we've had our conversations, but I think it was....</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> We've talked about today for a while, we've talked about this happening so Kate wasn't in the dark at all when we were planning it for at least a year if not longer, it was just finding the right time and that's what most people say about couples, it's all about timing. And I had my military career and I really wanted to concentrate on my flying and I couldn't have done this if I was still doing my training, so I've got that out of the way and Kate's in a good place in terms of work and were she wants to be and stuff and we both just decided now was a really good time.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> You are obviously going to enter this family, the most famous royal family in the world. William's mother was this massive iconic figure. The most famous figure of our age, is that worrying? Is that intimidating? Do you think about that a lot both of you, you particularly Kate, obviously?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Obviously I would have loved to have met her and she's obviously she's an inspirational woman to look up to. Obviously on this day and you know going forward and things, you know it is a wonderful family, the members who I've met have achieved a lot and you know very inspirational and so, yes, I do.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> There's no pressure though. There's no pressure, like Kate said it is about carving your own future. No one is going to try to fill my mother's shoes, what she did was fantastic. It's about making your own future and your own destiny and Kate will do a very good job of that.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> This is a life in the public domain to a degree that you can't escape, you both know that. You (William) obviously know it better than Kate does, you are obviously very protective of her.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Massively so. Of course. Her and her family, I really want to make sure they have the best sort of guidance and chance to see what life has been like or what life is like in the family, and that's kind of almost why I have been waiting this long, As I wanted to give her a chance to see in and to back out if she needed to before it all got too much. Because I'm not trying to learn from lessons done in the past and I just wanted to give her the best chance to settle in and to see what happens on the other side.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> I'm also glad that I've had the time to sort of grow and understand myself more as well so hopefully do good job.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Part of the reason it has taken you so long is you've both spent a long time contemplating the future, being calm about it, pondering it, thinking about it, is that right?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> It is. We've talked about it lots. So it's always been something we've had a good chat about and you know like I said both of us have come to the decision pretty much together, I just chose when to do it and how to do it and obviously being a real romantic I did it extremely well. (Laughing)</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, just coming to a close people have you know put some, placed some criticisms of you about your work and so on, does that hurt? How do you respond to people who say those things?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Well I think I know I've been working very hard for the family business, and sometimes those days are long days and you know I think if I know I'm working hard and I'm pulling my weight both work and playing hard at the same time, you know I think everyone who I work with can see I am there pulling my weight and that's really what matters to me.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> You know your family as you've said that you are very close, does it hurt about what's said or do you let it run off your collective backs on the grounds that's just what you have go to live with?</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> Well again I think, if you … the people around home are very supportive to us and you know those are the people who really matter to us, our close friends and family and I think if sort of they feel you are doing the right thing you can only be sort of true to yourself and you sort of have to ignore a lot of what's said, obviously take it on board, but you know you have to be yourself really and that's how I have stuck by it really.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> It's a massive thing you are going into now, you know obviously marriage is a big thing for everyone, but it's in such a public way, excited? A little bit terrified?</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Massively excited, quite happy when the interview's over, (laughter) but no we are hugely excited and we are looking forward to spending the rest of our times, the rest of our lives together and seeing what the future holds.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Kate, for you. You've had a long time to sort of contemplate this moment.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> Let's not over rig the long part. (Laughter)</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton:</b> It's obviously nerve-wracking, Because I don't know what I'm sort of … I don't know the ropes, William is obviously used to it, but no I'm willing to learn quickly and work hard.</p>

		<p><b>William:</b> She'll do really well. Very well.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> There are a lot of opportunities obviously within the family, a huge ability to change people's lives for the better, I guess that's something you must have contemplated as well.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton: </b>Yes, well I really hope I can make a difference, even in the smallest way. I am looking forward to helping as much as I can.</p>

		<p><b>TB:</b> Well thank you very much for talking to us. You look as I said at the start, very relaxed, very happy. Good luck.</p>

		<p><b>William: </b>Thank you.</p>

		<p><b>Miss Middleton: </b>Thank you.</p>

		<h1> Taylor Swift: 'My Confidence Is Easy To Shake'</h1>
		<img src="images/taylor1.jpg" style="width:500px" >
		<br>
		<br>

		<p>Once touted as a teen idol and a genre sensation, Taylor Swift is neither of those things today: At 22, she has become one of the biggest commercial forces in all of pop music. Her latest album, Red, sold 1.2 million copies in its first week — the highest such sales total in a decade. She spoke with NPR's Guy Raz about success, setbacks and why, in a career that began at 14, so many of her songs have dealt in love and heartbreak. Hear the radio version at the audio link on this page, and read more of their conversation below.</p>

		<p><b>GUY RAZ: You quote the poet Pablo Neruda right on the first page of the liner notes. The line is, "Love is so short, forgetting is so long." And it seems like that line sort of sets the theme for this record.</p></b>

		<p><b>TAYLOR SWIFT:</b> It really does. When I read that line, I absolutely connected to it. I felt like my favorite writers have almost musical hooks in their work, whether it's poetry or a hook at the end of a chapter that makes you want to read the next one. And I think that my favorite writers definitely have something musical about what they do, in saying something so relatable and universal and so simple.</p>


		<p><b>You write the vast majority of your songs, and a lot of your themes are about love or love lost and heartbreak. I sometimes wonder whether you date a lot of jerks.</p></b>

		
		<p>[Laughs.] I've written all my songs on every single one of my records, and that's what's been fun about looking back. My first album is the diary of when I was 14, 15, 16. My second album, Fearless, was from 16 to 18, and so on, and so on. So you have my life being recorded in journal entries from these two-year periods of my life since I was 16. I like to write about love and love lost because I feel like there are so many different subcategories of emotions that you can possibly delve into. I've never missed two people the same way — it's always different for me. I've never fallen in love with someone and had the same exact kind of feeling come over me. So I think that there are all these different mixtures of emotions that go into individual feelings that you feel for individual people. And, yeah, most of the time it doesn't work out.</p>

		<p>That's the thing with love: It's going to be wrong until it's right. So you experience these different shades of wrong, and you miss the good things about those people, and you regret not seeing the red flags for the bad things about those people, but it's all a learning process. And being 22, you're kind of in a crash course with love and life and lessons and learning the hard way, and thankfully, I've been able to write about those emotions as they've affected me.</p>
		



		<p><b>Is there a line that you won't cross when it comes to writing about how you feel?</p></b>

		<p>I don't think that I've ever experienced that line before.</p>

		<p><b>So it's really you speaking in your lyrics?</p></b>

		<p>Yeah. I've always written songs the same way. You learn different tricks — you learn craft, you learn structure, all that — as you go. Since I was 12, I would get an idea, and that idea is either a fragment of melody and lyric mixed in, [or] maybe it's a hook. Maybe it's the first line of a song. Maybe it's a background vocal part or something, but it's like the first piece of a puzzle. And my job in writing the song and completing it is filling in all the rest of the pieces and figuring out where they go. The reason why I keep doing it is because it's like a message in a bottle. You can put this message in a bottle, throw it out into the ocean, and maybe someday, the person that you wrote that song about is going to hear it and understand exactly how you felt. I think that's what keeps drawing me to songwriting: the spontaneity of how you can get an idea at 4 in the morning or while walking through the airport, and also the fact that it's conveying a message to someone that's more real than what you had the courage to say in person.</p>



		<p><b>In the liner notes, some of the letters in the lyrics are capitalized, and your fans know what that's about. These are clues for them to kind of piece things together. Do you see your lyrics as a way for you to directly communicate with your fans?</p></b>

		<p>The first thing that I think about when I'm writing my lyrics is directly communicating with the person the song is about. I think what I've learned recently is that it's not ... heartbreak that inspires my songs. It's not love that inspires my songs. It's individual people that come into my life. I've had relationships with people that were really substantial and meant a lot to me, but I couldn't write a song about that person for some reason. Then again, you'll meet someone that comes into your life for two weeks and you write an entire record about them. When I first started writing songs, I was always scared that my songs were too personal — like, if I put someone's name in a song, people won't relate to it as much. But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I'm going through — my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities — it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.</p>

		<p><b>A lot of people know you were a talented singer as a kid, but you actually experienced setbacks for many years before you made it, right?</p></b>

		<p>I started out with community theater, like local theater. I loved being on stage. I loved telling a story through words and music. I actually ended up going to auditions in New York for Broadway stuff. I didn't make it there. What I ended up coming back to is, I always was just so obsessed with the storytelling in country music. Shania Twain, Faith Hill, The Dixie Chicks — I was so taken in by their songs. So I started singing their songs at karaoke contests and singing every single weekend at something, trying out singing the national anthem here or there. When I was 12, I started playing guitar and writing my own songs, and that's when it became something I could never stop thinking about. It went into overdrive. I was always singing at some coffeehouse or some singer-songwriter night or this festival or that festival.It just became everything to me when I was about 12, and that's when I started really pressuring my parents to move to Nashville.</p>

		<p><b>What motivated you? Were you just convinced you were going to make it?</p></b>

		<p>No, actually. I was never convinced I was going to make it. And I look back — my mom and I reminisce about this all the time because we had no idea what we were doing. My parents bought books on what the music industry was like. They had no idea what the music industry entailed and what was involved with it. [Something that was] said to me early on was, "Teenagers don't listen to country music. That's not the audience. The audience is a 35-year-old housewife. ... How are you going to relate to those women when you're 16 years old? You should come back when you're in your 20s." And I kept thinking, "But I love country music, and I'm a teenager! There have to be more kids out there like me."</p>

		<br>

	

		<p><b>How do you deal with setbacks now? A few years ago, you were criticized by a few critics for a performance at the Grammy Awards. Did that shake your confidence?</p></b>

		<p>Absolutely. My confidence is easy to shake. I am very well aware of all of my flaws. I am aware of all the insecurities that I have. I have a lot of voices in my head constantly telling me I can't do it. I've dealt with that my whole life. And getting up there on stage thousands of times, you're going to have off nights. And when you have an off night in front of that many people, and it's pointed out in such a public way, yeah, that gets to you. I feel like, as a songwriter, I can't develop thick skin. I cannot put up protective walls, because it's my job to feel things.</p>

		<p>The kind of magical way that criticism has helped me is that that's another thing that I put into my music. I ended up writing a song called "Mean" about that experience, and about this one particular guy who would not get off my case about it. To stand up at the Grammys two years later, to sing that song and get a standing ovation for it, and to win two Grammys for that particular song, I think was the most gratifying experience I've ever had in my life.</p>



		<p><b>There's one song on the new album called "The Last Time," which you sing with Gary Lightbody of the band Snow Patrol, that's particularly heartbreaking. Where does that come from? You have this bright, upbeat personality and this charisma that's been written about so much, and yet there's a lot of pain in what you write about.</p></b>

		<p>The idea was based on this experience I had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy. You never know when he's going to leave, you never know when he's going to come back, but he always does come back. My visual for this song is, there's a guy on his knees sitting on the ground outside of a door. And on the other side of the door is his girlfriend, who he keeps on leaving — and he keeps coming back to her, but then he leaves again. He's saying, "This is the last time I'm going to do this to you." And she's saying, "This is the last time I'm asking you this: Don't do this again." And she's wondering whether to let him in, and he just wants her to give him another chance, but she doesn't know if he's going to break her heart again. It's a really fragile emotion you're dealing with when you want to love someone, but you don't know if it's smart to.</p>

		<p><b>This is an election weekend, and I know that the day you turned 18, you registered to vote. You've also said that you want to wait to take public positions on issues; that you want to feel comfortable enough to defend them. Are you there yet?</p></b>

		<p>No, I'm not. I think at 22, I'm still gathering information about who I am as a person. I look at a lot of people's interviews on their lives, [and] I talk to a lot of people who are older than me — I have a great respect for gray hair. A lot of people tell me that when they were 22, they thought they had it all figured out, but they didn't. Just when I start to think that I know how I feel about something, I learn something else that changes my mind. I just feel like I don't have enough wisdom about myself as a person yet to go out there and say to 20 million followers on Twitter, and these people on Facebook, and whoever else is reading whatever interview I do, "Vote for this person." I know who I'm going to vote for, but I don't think that it's important for me to say it, because it will influence people one way or another. And I just want to make sure that every public decision I make is an educated one.</p>

		<p><b>For most people, the time to make mistakes is when you're 22. Do you feel like, because of your public persona, you can't?</p></b>

		<p>I do think about it. There's not really one day that goes by that my life isn't documented somewhere. I live in a world where I know for a fact that my grandkids will get to Google what I wore today. It's a strange dilemma because it puts an amount of pressure on your every move that other 22-year-olds don't necessarily have to think about. In the grand scheme of things, I'm living a life. ... I know I'm going to make mistakes. I'm just going to try to handle those mistakes as a good person. The perception of you is going to change daily when you do what I do, but I just want to end up knowing in my heart that I did that right thing and tried my best, and if you mess up, hopefully it teaches you something.</p>

		<h1>Jennifer Lawrence's role in Hunger Games</h1>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p><b>Since 2008 you’ve had three Academy nominations and won an award. You worked with influential directors and in successful movies, and you’ve reached an impressive payroll, 10 million dollars for each one of the three Hunger Games sequels. What is your goal after all this?</p></b>

		<p>It hasn’t been that many years, but they’ve been intense years. I had the chance to work with amazing directors and just as many amazing actors. I’ve realized the ultimate dream of any actress: be on top as a young actress, and in a short time. Now, my dream is to slack a little!</p>

		<p><b>What’s your idea of slacking?</p></b>
		
		<p>I don’t have a clear-cut idea: I’d just like not to have to work for a little while, be on the fringe, on the outskirts of Hollywood, hopefully driving around in a minivan (laughs).</p>

		<p><b>Can you describe the changes in The Hunger Games series throughout the three movies?</p></b>

		<p>Different directors gave their personal view to Katniss’ story. Gary Ross began the work, and Francis Lawrence carried it on. Francis gave a dark turn to the series, as he focused on the characters’ psychology. There are emotional and charged-up sequences which alternate with an in-depth analysis of characters’ behavior. The last two movies are a lot darker: it’s all grey, even in color. Katniss and her companions are suffering from PTSD. After Catching Fire they have to find themselves again and regain their strength.</p>

		<p><b>In every movie of the series there is a favorite scene, one that is more unforgettable than the others. What’s your favourite scene in Mockingjay Part 1 and 2?</p></b>
		
		<p>I’d say all the scenes with Julianne Moore, who plays President Alma Coin. She and Katniss are two strong and determined women. They have a similar vision of the world, but their ideas about the way to change it are completely different. Katniss is, with no self-consciousness, a threat to President Coin. I think that their relationship is very interesting and intense.</p>

		<p><b>How did you train to be ready for these two movies?</p></b>
		
		<p>Truth to be told, in the first part of Mockingjay, Katniss doesn’t have to go back to the Hunger Games, so she didn’t have a lot of stunts or fight scenes. Katniss has to adjust to life in District 13. She isn’t looking very good, and isn’t very healthy or strong. The first chapter will focus on my character more emotionally than physically.</p>

		<p><b>And in Mockingjay – Part 2?</p></b>
		
		<p>That’s another story! It will be an action movie, because it’s focused on the final war. There are a lot more stunts, violence, fights and gunshots. We shot it back-to-back with the first part, even though it will come out next year (on November, 20, 2015) but I had the time to train between shoots.</p>

		<p><b>So, you’re a professional archer now?</p></b>

		<p>I wouldn’t say professional, but don’t try to break into my house! (laughs)</p>

		<p><b>Do you have your personal bow at home?</p></b>

		<p>Sure. I don’t have much time to train, except for when I train for the movies, but learning how to shoot better is always a goal! Maybe I’ll take some additional lessons with my trainer for the series (Kathuna Lorig, who won a bronze medal for archery at Barcelona Olympics in 1992).</p>

		<p><b>You became an actress when you were really young. Did you ever wish to become something else, when you were a child?</p></b>

		<p>I committed to become an actress in five years. Otherwise I would have been a nurse. Or a doctor.</p>

		<p><b>Can you tell us one of your secrets?</p></b>

		<p>I don’t know I have any secrets (laughs). I love my job and that makes me really happy. But acting is a small part of me, I’d say more or less 3%.</p>

		<p><b>In a previous interview you told someone you didn’t know where your Oscar was…</p></b>

		<p>Now I know! It is at my mom’s! I wanted to hide it, but she said we had to show it off, keep it in plain sight. I didn’t agree because every time somebody came over, it just seemed like I wanted them to see it. So we compromised: the Oscar is at my parents’ house. They keep it on the piano.</p>

		<p><b>Do you have a different approach to playing characters like Katniss or Mystique in X-Men than the characters you played on David O. Russell’s movies?</p></b>

		<p>I wouldn’t say different approaches. Sometimes it helps me to think about how another actor would play my character. Watching yourself from the outside is an essential key for every actor. I usually think about my character played by a particualr person in my everyday life, a man whose name I wouldn’t tell you even if you tortured me.</p>

		<p><b>To play your character in Winter’s Bone, Debra Granik’s movie for which you did receive your first nomination for an Academy Award, you had to learn how to skin a squirrel. Is it the oddest thing you had to learn on a movie set?</p></b>

		<p>It surely is the most revolting thing I ever learned. I think I am the only actress alive who knows how to skin a squirrel. But I am happy I know how to do it, it could come useful later in life. You never know…</p>
