    		My quilt is for giving messages to people through the quotes of Alice in wonderland. Basically, I used various images, quotes and animated gifs from movie and book and put them into diamond shape. And Alice in wonderland is a mysterious story so I wanted to express the mysterious feeling through the color schemes and graphic works.</p>
